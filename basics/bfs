The purpose of BFS is to find the shortest path from a vertex to any other vertex.
This is done by radially searching outwards from origin vertex.

Procedure:
Current = Origin
1. Set all vertices to white

2.Add all white vertices adjacent to current to queue and color them gray. Set parent and all gray adjacent as black.
  Gray means in the queue already.
3.For every Node added to queue set its distance from origin to distance to current from origin + 1

4. repeat 2 and 3 until queue empty
5. return distance of query'd node
